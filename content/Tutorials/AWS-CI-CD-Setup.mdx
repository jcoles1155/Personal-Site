# CI/CD Flow w/ Github Actions to EC2 w/ Ubuntu Docker and Nginx

---

For use with: https://github.com/Two-Trees-Digital/turbo-temp

### **EC2 Setup**

1. Go to Amazon account and create a new EC2
2. Choose the Ubuntu option
3. Choose a system size that suits your project needs
   1. Medium and below is probably the most you’ll need with hobby projects
4. Create a .pem permissions file to be able to ssh into the system
5. Allot 12-20 GBs of space for system
6. Create Instance
7. Once Instance is created, go ahead and open a terminal where the .pem file got downloaded
   1. Probably /user/downloads
8. Press ‘connect to instance’ and select the ssh tab
   1. Copy paste that command into terminal
9. You’ve now connected to your instance
10. Proceed with downloading Docker

### **Docker**

1. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

**Nginx EC2**

1. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04
2. Once through setup, you’ll need to go into your config file and input your settings

   ```jsx
   cd / etc / nginx;
   ```

   ```jsx
   cd sites-available
   ```

   ```jsx
   ls;
   ```

3. You’ll see a file named default here

   1. We want to delete this

   ```jsx
   sudo rm -rf default
   ```

4. We now create a new default file with:

   ```jsx
   sudo nano default
   ```

5. Copy pasta your config settings:

Config File:

```jsx
`server {``listen 80;``location / {``proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;``}``location /api/v1 {``rewrite ^/api/v1(/.*)$ $1 break;``proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;``}``location /dashboard/ {``rewrite ^/dashboard(/.*)$ $1 break;``proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3002;``}``}`;
```

1. Write out w/ ‘ctrl + O’
2. Exit w/ ‘ctrl + X’
3. We now want to cd out and into sites-enabled and delete the default file there too

   ```jsx
   cd ..
   ```

   ```jsx
   cd sites-enabled
   ```

   ```jsx
   sudo rm -rf default
   ```

4. Now we’re going to run a link command

Link Command:

```jsx
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

1.  Now restart the nginx server and we’re good to go!

Nginx Command:

```jsx
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
```

```jsx
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

### **Github Actions**

Set up of the actions are pretty straight forward

1. Go to your github repository, and go to the **settings tab**
2. Then go to **Actions > Runners**
3. Create **New Self-Hosted Runner**
4. Input the commands it prompts you with 1 by 1 at the root of your EC2
5. After **sudo ./svc.sh start**
   1. Check the runners tab again to see your idle runner ready to go

### **Building the project**

1. Running **sudo docker ps** shows there isn’t a built image of a container yet in the EC2
2. Make a test commit to the production or main branch of your code
   1. Check the Actions tab in your repository to see a workflow run has been created
3. After the initial build completes, which may take a while, give **sudo docker ps** another try to see your container created!

### Building Image

```jsx
docker-compose build turbo-temp

docker-compose up --no-deps -d turbo-temp
```
