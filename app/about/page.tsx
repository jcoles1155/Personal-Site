                </h2>
                <p>
                  I'm a software engineer with about 5 years of experience in a
                  variety of domains. For the past few years, I've built
                  logistics software with Curri in a high paced coding
                  environment - working with finance, and internal tooling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I grew up in Bakersfield California, and after bouncin around
                  from San Diego to Costa Mesa catching as many waves as I
                  could; I landed in Ventura - the land of the point break -
                  where I currently still reside! Fun facts are I've worked in
                  the beer and wine industry in many capacities, and love to
                  play music with friends!
